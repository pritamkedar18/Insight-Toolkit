In addition, technological advancements in manufacturing processes are improving the quality of these bags, making them more durable and affordable for both manufacturers and consumers. The market's future prospects are also bolstered by the increase in the number of awareness campaigns, educational programs, and collaborations between government agencies, NGOs, and businesses. These initiatives are geared towards reducing plastic waste and promoting sustainable alternatives like canvas and muslin bags.
